        <h2>11 August, 2020 - <a href="#11-aug-2020">0.2.1-beta6 submitted for review</a></h2>
        <p>
          Hello to everyone! I am here with some happier news on Olifant
          development.  I've submitted a new version for review, mostly with
          bug fixes and improvements on support of pleroma instances. Here are
          things that were fixed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>* Fixed loading of accounts, whenever you are signed in into more than one at once</li>
          <li>* Changed the way HTML tags were dropped, now more posts will be able to be displayed non-empty</li>
          <li>* Implemented correct tags parsing of statuses that came from Pleroma</li>
          <li>* Updated visual icons of empty state and application itself (kudos to <a href="https://github.com/hanaral">@hanaral</a>)</li>
          <li>* Dropped authenticated queries at places, where they are not needed</li>
          <li>* Improved loading of images, that caused crashes sometimes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Those may seem like small things, but they are very important for project to be
          nice for users. I hope you enjoy recent improvements.
        </p>
        <p>Stay safe and tuned with the project!</op>

        <h2>03 August, 2020 - <a href="#03-aug-2020">Pleroma and multi-account improvements</a></h2>
        <p>Hey guys! It's time for the next update on Olifant.</p>
        <p>
          For last week, most of the work that was done on Olifant was aimed to
          improve multi-account and Pleroma support. While multi-account support
          is still under progress and needs lots of fixes, posts created on Pleroma
          will work a lot better: sometimes hashtags and profile clicks opened
          browser. It will no longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding new features: there is nothing new to tell. Image displayment is
          in slow progress, and all other features are waiting for their time at the
          moment.
        </p>

        <h2>27 July, 2020 - <a href="#27-jul-2020">First update</a></h2>
        <p><i>Some meta before actual update.</i></p>
        <p>
          After job change, it took some effort for me not to abandon the project
          like it happened before. So, I think I can say that I am getting better
          with it. But, there was no regular informational updates about progress and
          things I am working on... until now.
        </p>
        <p><i>End of meta.</i></p>

        <p>
          So, let's head to the actual update. Last week I had a vacation, that
          didn't go that good I expected from it, so I couldn't do much on
          development side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have started thinking on how displaying images can be done inside Olifant
          itself without opening a browser, have made some first steps towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for more help from @hanaral, the project have an icons slightly
          improved: the logo was slightly tweaked for details and empty data icon was
          drastically improved in visibility for both light and dark mode. Those
          changes will be available in next version of Olifant.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is it for the first update. Stay tuned for any new updates on Olifant!
