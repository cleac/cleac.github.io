        <h2>27 July, 2020 - <a href="#27-jul-2020">First update</a></h2>
        <p><i>Some meta before actual update.</i></p>
        <p>
          After job change, it took some effort for me not to abandon the project
          like it happened before. So, I think I can say that I am getting better
          with it. But, there was no regular informational updates about progress and
          things I am working on... until now.
        </p>
        <p><i>End of meta.</i></p>
      
        <p>
          So, let's head to the actual update. Last week I had a vacation, that
          didn't go that good I expected from it, so I couldn't do much on
          development side.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have started thinking on how displaying images can be done inside Olifant
          itself without opening a browser, have made some first steps towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for more help from @hanaral, the project have an icons slightly
          improved: the logo was slightly tweaked for details and empty data icon was
          drastically improved in visibility for both light and dark mode. Those
          changes will be available in next version of Olifant.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is it for the first update. Stay tuned for any new updates on Olifant!
