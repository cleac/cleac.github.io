  <h2>11 August, 2020 - <a href="#11-aug-2020">0.2.1-beta6 submitted for review</a></h2>

  <p>

    Hello to everyone! I am here with some happier news on Olifant development.
    I've submitted a new version for review, mostly with bug fixes and
    improvements on support of pleroma instances. Here are things that were
    fixed:

  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>Fixed loading of accounts, whenever you are signed in into more than one at once</li>

    <li>Changed the way HTML tags were dropped, now more posts will be able to be displayed non-empty</li>

    <li>Implemented correct tags parsing of statuses that came from Pleroma</li>

    <li>Updated visual icons of empty state and application itself (kudos to <a href="https://github.com/hanaral">@hanaral</a>)</li>

    <li>Dropped authenticated queries at places, where they are not needed</li>

    <li>Improved loading of images, that caused crashes sometimes</li>

  </ul>

  <p>

    Those may seem like small things, but they are very important for project to be

    nice for users. I hope you enjoy recent improvements.

  </p>

  <p>Stay safe and tuned with the project!</op>
