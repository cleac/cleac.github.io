      <h1>Minimal Tech</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        It is a small project of mine about possibility to live in modern life
        while using the most of things software gives to us. The general idea is
        about using simpler or/and older software and try getting most of it,
        including all the requirements of modern tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is more like a web log, rather than a blog page of some
        kind. I will sometimes post random small things about what I've
        discovered and/or tried, and what is my experience about it.

        <h3>18 May, 2019 - Getting Brütal <sup><a href="#18-may-2019">(link)</a></sup></h3>
        <p>
          This is a first entry inside this log. First, I've decided to start
          tracking all the interesting and fun things I find about simple and
          sometimes obscure technologies. Why public? Because I can! Also,
          because there is not much people around me use those simpler tech,
          while in fact they can do not less things, but them more
          optimal/fast from many perspectives.

          Well, for last year I am an active user of mastodon social network.
          It's fediverse, and blah-blah-blah. I would like to mention one
          project, I've got myself lately: it is
          <a href="https://brutaldon.online">brutaldon project</a>. It is
          a brutalistic (brütal) interface for masto. Although I know about it for
          some time, I didn't use it, because didn't get the reason why should
          I do it (the default interface is column-based, fast enough and
          pretty optimized). However, on phone it is easier to use brutaldon.
          Also, brutaldon looks better in small window than the original
          frontend version. That makes it less distractive for me to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are things I don't like much about brutaldon. First is that
          it is written in python. Then over high load it will be pretty slow,
          so it is better to host it yourself instead of using the original
          version. Second thing is that to mention someone correctly, you have
          to know the nickname exactly (so when I want to mention someone I
          don't remember the instance of, I start the original web version,
          write a post and close it afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>I totally recommend at least to try using it for several days.</p>
