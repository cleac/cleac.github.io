      <h1>Minimal Tech</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        It is a small project of mine about possibility to live in modern life
        while using the most of things software gives to us. The general idea is
        about using simpler or/and older software and try getting most of it,
        including all the requirements of modern tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is more like a web log, rather than a blog page of some
        kind. I will sometimes post random small things about what I've
        discovered and/or tried, and what is my experience about it.

        <h2>5 June, 2019 - Mail in the terminal (part 1)<sup><a href="#5-june-2019">(link)</a></sup></h2>
        <p>
          I have been wanting to try out mutt for several times now. It's just
          too much of people speaking about it's awesomeness, so I couldn't
          resist. I've tried running it several times, but without any
          success... Now I am sure I won't leave it. Somewhat sure *laughing*
        </p>
        <p>
          I should be clear here. mutt is noway a minimal application, but when
          things come to handling e-mails, you simply can't keep things
          minimal. If it has at least some use-base, it already should already
          support different protocols, have possibility to group messages
          somehow, store draft, etc. So, <u>mutt is not minimal</u>. But
          compared to other email-clients, it <b>is</b> simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          About the entry into mutt. It's a bit harder to enter this
          application than other email clients, because it has default
          configuration that reads all the emails from local pool. And, the
          thing that bothers a lot: the first step is the hardest, because it
          takes time and lots of documentation to read to understand that code
          "<i>set folder = "imaps://login@server:123"</i>" does specify the
          target, where do you want to read emails from. It's a bit
          counterintuitive for newcomers. But I've figured this out, and, I
          think, this should be mentioned more explicit.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, after figuring this out, things are pretty simple and easy to
          use. However, I have some things in my todo list to figure out,
          like mailing lists support and some other.

        <h2>22 May, 2019 - Music in the Terminal <sup><a href="#22-may-2019">(link)</a></sup></h2>
        <p>
          Mostly I listen to my music using the terminal music player called
          <a href="https://cmus.github.io/">cmus</a>. It is really a great
          music player, which allows me easily and very fast index my music
          collection and play pretty any song. I just put it inside my tmux
          session and just use it. Very fast, very lightweight and very
          reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is possible to integrate with it easily using the
          <a href="https://github.com/cmus/cmus/blob/master/Doc/cmus-remote.txt">cmus-remote</a>.
          I think, KDE uses this api and is able to integrate with cmus, so you
          will be able to use the "Media" widget to control your music. And all
          this in minimal design, fast and very light. However, sometimes it
          badly accepts unicode, but generally everything is ok.

        <h2>18 May, 2019 - Getting Brütal <sup><a href="#18-may-2019">(link)</a></sup></h2>
        <p>
          This is a first entry inside this log. First, I've decided to start
          tracking all the interesting and fun things I find about simple and
          sometimes obscure technologies. Why public? Because I can! Also,
          because there is not much people around me use those simpler tech,
          while in fact they can do not less things, but more optimal/fast from
          many perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, for last year I am an active user of mastodon social network.
          It's fediverse, and blah-blah-blah. I would like to mention one
          project, I've got myself lately: it is
          <a href="https://brutaldon.online">brutaldon project</a>. It is
          a brutalistic (brütal) interface for masto. Although I know about it
          for some time, I didn't use it, because didn't get the reason why
          should I do it (the default interface is column-based, fast enough
          and pretty optimized). However, on phone it is easier to use
          brutaldon. Also, brutaldon looks better in small window than the
          original frontend version. That makes it less distractive for me to
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are things I don't like much about brutaldon. First is that
          it is written in python. Then over high load it will be pretty slow,
          so it is better to host it yourself instead of using the original
          version. Second thing is that to mention someone correctly, you have
          to know the nickname exactly (so when I want to mention someone I
          don't remember the instance of, I start the original web version,
          write a post and close it afterwards).
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite issues, I totally recommend at least to try using it for
          several days. It can fit your way!
